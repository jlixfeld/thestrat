# Support Policy

## ðŸš« No Support Provided for This Implementation

This repository contains my personal implementation of tools related to The Strat trading methodology. **I do not provide support, bug fixes, or assistance** for this code.

## Why No Support?

I'm sharing this code to contribute to The Strat community and inspire others to build their own tools. However:

- This is my personal project built for my specific needs
- Supporting external users would turn sharing into a job
- The community benefits more when traders build tools suited to their own workflows
- I want to focus on trading, not tech support

## What You Should Do Instead

### ðŸŽ¯ For Learning The Strat Methodology
- **Official Content**: Check out Rob Smith's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@smithsintheblack)
- **Community**: Join the discussion at [#TheStrat on X/Twitter](https://x.com/hashtag/TheStrat) 
- **Facebook Group**: [TheStrat Community](https://m.facebook.com/groups/TheStrat/)

### ðŸ”¨ For Building Your Own Tools
1. **Study the concepts** from official Strat community sources
2. **Learn the methodology** thoroughly before building software
3. **Design your own implementation** that fits your specific trading style and needs
4. **Use this code for inspiration only** - don't copy it

### ðŸ¤” If This Code Doesn't Work for You
- **That's normal and expected** - it was built for my environment and needs
- **Build your own version** that works in your setup
- **This is actually better** - your implementation will fit your workflow perfectly

## Community Resources

The Strat community has excellent resources for learning the methodology:
- Official educational content from Rob Smith
- Community forums and discussion groups  
- Other traders' perspectives and implementations
- Study groups and educational sessions

## Final Note

My goal is to inspire other Strat traders to create their own tools, not to provide a ready-made solution. The strongest Strat implementations are the ones built by traders for their own specific needs.

**Build your own. Make it yours. Trade it successfully.**

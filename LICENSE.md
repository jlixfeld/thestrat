## The Strat Methodology

**IMPORTANT:** This copyright only applies to the specific code implementation in this repository.

The underlying trading methodology known as "The Strat" belongs to the community and was developed by Rob Smith. I make no claims to ownership of:
- The Strat concepts, strategies, or methodologies
- The terminology "The Strat" or related language
- Any educational content about The Strat approach
- Community-developed variations or improvements

You are completely free to:
- Learn and use The Strat methodology in your trading
- Create your own software implementations of Strat concepts
- Participate in The Strat community
- Develop and share your own Strat-related tools

## Why No License?

I'm sharing this code to inspire other Strat traders to build their own tools, not to provide a ready-made solution. The trading community benefits most when each trader develops tools suited to their specific needs and style.

If you find value in my approach, I encourage you to:
1. Study The Strat methodology from community sources
2. Design your own implementation that fits your workflow
3. Build something that works for your specific trading setup

## Contact

If you have a specific need to use portions of this code in your own project, please contact me to discuss licensing terms. However, I generally encourage building your own implementation instead.
